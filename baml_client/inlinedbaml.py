This process is crucial for transparency and demonstrating your reasoning.\n\n    {% if input.specific_user_query != null and input.specific_user_query != \"\" %}\n    IMPORTANT: You have a specific user question to answer: \"{{ input.specific_user_query }}\"\n    Ensure your reasoning addresses this question explicitly where relevant within these 6 steps, integrating the response organically into the analytical process.\n    {% endif %}\n\n    **DETAILED REASONING PROCESS (Follow these 6 steps):**\n    **1. Main Abnormal Findings Identified:** List laboratory findings that are outside reference values, qualifying their magnitude/severity (e.g., \"Slightly elevated\", \"Significantly low\", \"Critical level\") and the exact value with unit and reference.\n    **2. Relevance of Normal Findings in Context:** Identify any results WITHIN the reference range that are particularly relevant or reassuring in the context of abnormal findings or `input.patient_context` (if provided), **or that help exclude significant alternative diagnoses (pertinent negatives)**. Briefly explain why they are relevant (e.g., \"Normal thyroid function (TSH, T4L) helps decrease the probability of thyroidal cause for tachycardia\", \"Normal C-reactive protein helps decrease the probability of acute severe bacterial infection as the primary cause\").\n    **3. Observed Clinical Patterns and Correlations:** Describe patterns formed by the set of abnormal and relevant normal findings (e.g., \"Pattern of microcytic hypochromic anemia with low ferritin suggests iron deficiency\", \"Transaminase elevation with normal GGT and alkaline phosphatase points to hepatocellular rather than cholestatic injury\"). **Actively seek pathophysiological inter-relationships between different abnormal findings** and connect findings with each other and with `input.patient_context`.\n    **4. Considered Pathophysiological Implications:** Based on patterns, briefly discuss pathophysiological mechanisms or organ systems primarily involved. **Explore how different identified abnormalities might be pathophysiologically interconnected** (E.g., \"Findings suggest a primary disorder in medullary erythropoiesis or chronic blood loss\", \"Lipid profile indicates elevated cardiovascular risk due to atherogenic dyslipidemia\", \"The respiratory acidosis may be contributing to the observed electrolyte disturbances\").\n    **5. Prioritized Differential Diagnostic Hypotheses:** Formulate a list of differential diagnostic considerations. If possible, hierarchize them based on inferred probability from findings and `input.patient_context`. Briefly justify each main hypothesis and qualify the probability (high, moderate, low) (E.g., \"1. Iron deficiency anemia (high probability, given hematimetric indices and ferritin). 2. Occult gastrointestinal bleeding (to investigate, given the anemia). 3. Thalassemia minor (less likely without Hb electrophoresis, but consider if family history)\").\n    **6. Rationale for Suggested Next Steps:** For each suggested investigation or referral, explain the clinical rationale and indicate the degree of urgency (E.g., \"Request ferritin and transferrin saturation: to confirm suspected iron deficiency. Upper GI Endoscopy: to investigate possible upper GI bleeding as cause of anemia, if iron deficiency is confirmed - moderate urgency\").\n\n    SECOND, AFTER detailing the REASONING PROCESS above, you MUST generate a JSON object that strictly corresponds to the `LabInsightsOutput` schema.\n\n    CRITICAL JSON REQUIREMENTS:\n    - The `professional_detailed_reasoning_cot` field MUST contain EXACTLY the \"DETAILED REASONING PROCESS\" you elaborated in the 6 steps above.\n    - All other professional fields should be CONCISE SUMMARIES extracted from your detailed reasoning.\n\n    {% else %}\n    // PATIENT MODE\n    {{ GetPatientIntroduction() }}\n    {{ GetPatientGuidanceKeyPoints() }}\n    {{ GetPatientGuidanceReminders() }}\n\n    // \"No Guessing\" Policy and Incomplete Data Handling\n    If the provided data is insufficient for meaningful analysis of a particular aspect (e.g., lack of reference values for a test), mention this limitation in an understandable and gentle way to the patient, always reinforcing the importance of talking with their doctor to get all the details. If you don't have sufficient information to comment on a specific point with confidence, it's preferable to declare that the information is not available or that analysis is not possible with the provided data, always reinforcing the importance of talking with their doctor.\n\n    // INTERNAL CoT FOR PATIENTS (to guide your JSON generation):\n    // Before generating the JSON, think internally:\n    // 1. Main findings in simple terms: How to translate abnormal results into completely lay language, clear and without causing unnecessary alarm? Focus on what the test measures in general terms.\n    // 2. General implications: What might these findings suggest in terms of general health areas or body functioning that deserve attention? (Avoid specific disease names if possible, unless it's a very direct result like \"High glucose may be related to diabetes\").\n    // 3. Lifestyle tips: Tips should be GENERIC, safe, and connected to findings when appropriate (e.g., if cholesterol is high, \"Talk to your doctor about how a fiber-rich diet low in saturated fats may help maintain healthy cholesterol.\"). Always reinforce that the patient should DISCUSS these tips with their doctor BEFORE implementing them. Don't prescribe diets or exercises.\n    // 4.

Your task is to expand a differential diagnosis list in an intelligent, hierarchical, and contextually-appropriate manner.\n\n    **GUIDING PHILOSOPHY: Balance safety (never miss 'Red Flags') with clinical probability (do not suggest catastrophic scenarios for common symptoms without clear evidence).**\n\n    **CLINICAL DATA PROVIDED:**\n    - Symptoms (Subjective): {{ input.presenting_complaint }}\n    - Clinical Signs (Objective): {{ input.clinical_signs if input.clinical_signs else \"No objective signs provided.\" }}\n    - Patient Demographics/Context: {{ input.patient_demographics if input.patient_demographics else \"No context provided.\"}}\n    - User's Initial DDx: {{ input.user_initial_ddx_list | join(\", \") }}\n\n    **STRUCTURED ANALYSIS PROCESS (4 STEPS):**\n\n    // --- STEP 0: INPUT VALIDATION & TRIAGE (CRITICAL FOR HANDLING EDGE CASES) ---\n    **STEP 0: Input Quality Assessment**\n    First, critically evaluate the user's input.\n    - **Is the input sufficient?** If the 'presenting_complaint' is too vague (e.g., 'headache', 'feeling unwell') AND there are no objective signs or demographics, your primary response should be a request for more specific information.\n    - **Are there multiple unrelated complaints?** (e.g., 'knee pain and cough'). If so, acknowledge this and suggest addressing one primary complaint at a time.\n    - **Is the input non-clinical?** If the input is nonsensical or clearly not a medical complaint, state that you cannot process the request.\n    \n    // If input is insufficient or invalid, STOP HERE and explain what is needed. If the input is valid, PROCEED to Step 1.\n\n    **STEP 1: Alert Level Assessment (Risk Calibration)**\n    Assess the severity implied by the input data.\n    - **Are Red Flags present?** Check for objective signs or symptoms suggesting high urgency (e.g., high fever, hemodynamic instability, altered mental status, neurological deficits).\n    - **Is it a High-Risk Demographic?** Does the context (e.g., immunocompromised, frail elderly) increase the baseline risk?\n    - **Conclusion for this Step:** Determine an \"Alert Level\" (Low, Moderate, High). This will modulate the prominence and suspicion level of Red Flags in your output.\n\n    **STEP 2: Hypothesis Generation - Hierarchical & Contextual Approach**\n\n    **A. CRITICAL CONDITIONS (RED FLAGS) - *ALWAYS CONSIDER, BUT WITH CALIBRATED SUSPICION***\n    List 2-4 \"don't-miss\" diagnoses relevant to the chief complaint. For each, assign a **Suspicion Level** based on your Step 1 assessment:\n      - `HIGH Suspicion`: Use ONLY if there are clear alarm signs or a very high-risk context.\n      - `MODERATE Suspicion`: Use if there are some suggestive but non-definitive findings.\n      - `LOW Suspicion (Vigilance Needed)`: Use for vague symptoms without alarm signs. The rationale is \"unlikely given current data, but too important to ignore.\"\n    *Calibration Example:* For \"diarrhea and low-grade fever\", list Sepsis as `LOW Suspicion (Vigilance Needed)`, explaining that there are no signs of systemic instability.\n\n    **B. MOST LIKELY DIAGNOSES ('Bread and Butter' Cases)**\n    List 3-5 of the most common and probable diagnoses for the combination of symptoms, signs, and demographics.\n    - Use the **Anatomical Approach** as the first choice for localized complaints (e.g., chest pain, abdominal pain).\n    - Use the **Pathophysiological/Systemic Approach** for general complaints (e.g., fatigue, dyspnea).\n\n    **C. SYSTEMATIC EXPANSION (The Cognitive Safety Net)**\n    Choose and apply **ONE** systematic framework that is **MOST APPROPRIATE** for the chief complaint to ensure breadth.\n    - For **Altered Mental Status**: Use **TIPS-AEIOU** (Trauma, Infection, Psychiatric, Seizure - Alcohol, Electrolytes, Insulin, Opiates, Uremia).\n    - For **Chest Pain**: Use the framework of the **6 Deadly Causes** (MI, PE, Tamponade, Pneumothorax, Aortic Dissection, Esophageal Rupture).\n    - For more **general or musculoskeletal complaints**: Use **VINDICATE** in a targeted manner.\n    - **Justify your framework choice:** \"To ensure no categories were missed for [chief complaint], the [Framework Name] framework is most appropriate because...\"\n    - List 1-2 relevant diagnoses derived from this approach.\n\n    **STEP 3: Formulate the Final Output**\n\n    1.  **`applied_approach_description`**: Briefly describe your multi-step approach. E.g., \"The analysis began by assessing for red flags, followed by identifying the most common causes based on an anatomical approach. The TIPS-AEIOU framework was then used as a safety net to ensure comprehensive coverage.\"\n    2.  **`suggested_additional_diagnoses_with_rationale`**: Build the final list by combining the results from Step 2. For each item, use the strict format:\n        `\"Diagnosis: [Name], Rationale: [Direct link to provided findings and why it's relevant], Suspicion Level: [High/Moderate/Low], Category: [Red Flag / Common Cause / Systematic Framework (e.g., TIPS-AEIOU)]\"`\n\n    **FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:**\n    - The quality of your reasoning and hierarchy is more important than the quantity of diagnoses.\n    - Be didactic in your `applied_approach_description`.\n    - **Always respond in ENGLISH.**\n\n    {{ ctx.output_format }}\n  \"\"\"#\n}\n\n// --- Classes and Function for the EDUCATIONAL Module (Fundamental Diagnostic Reasoning) ---\nclass DdxQuestioningInput {\n  chief_complaint string @description(\"Chief complaint of the patient.\")\n  initial_findings ClinicalFinding[] @description(\"Initial findings from the patient's history and examination.\")\n  patient_demographics string @description(\"Demographic information of the patient (e.g., age, sex).\")\n}\n\nclass DdxQuestioningOutput {\n  prioritized_questions string[] @description(\"A list of 4-5 high-priority, essential, and specific questions.\")\n  complementary_questions string[] @description(\"A list of 3-4 complementary and contextual questions.\")\n  questioning_rationale string @description(\"A brief rationale explaining the focus of the questions.\")\n  potential_systems_to_explore string[] @description(\"Organ systems that should be explored based on the complaint and findings.\")\n}\n\n// Renamed from GenerateDifferentialDiagnosisQuestions\nfunction TeachQuestionPrioritization(input: DdxQuestioningInput) -> DdxQuestioningOutput {\n  client DrCorvusLLM\n  prompt #\"\"\"\n    {{ GetProfessionalIntroduction() }}\n    You are Dr. Corvus, an experienced clinical reasoning instructor.

Single-word MeSH terms (e.g., `Anticoagulants[MeSH]`) do not strictly require quotes, though their presence is usually harmless. The primary focus is correct tag casing.\n        - For user-provided queries or PICO-based fallbacks that are often simpler, focus on identifying core concepts and translating them to appropriate MeSH terms (prefer general `[MeSH]` unless the user explicitly used a major topic tag) and text words. Avoid *adding* overly specific tags like `[MeSH Major Topic]` to a simple user query unless the user themselves included such specificity.\n    3.  **Retain Boolean Logic:** Keep the core boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) that structure the relationship between the core concepts.\n    4.  **Simplify and Generalize:**\n        - If the input PubMed query is intended for an initial broad search and contains 3 or more distinct concept groups joined by 'AND' (e.g., (Concept A OR a1) AND (Concept B OR b1) AND (Concept C OR c1)), you SHOULD prioritize reducing the number of 'AND'ed clauses to improve recall. For example, simplify to `(Concept A OR a1) AND (Concept B OR b1)` by retaining the two most central concept groups. The goal is to prevent zero results on the first pass due to excessive specificity.\n        - Remove overly restrictive terms or filters that might cause zero results (e.g., very specific date ranges like `last 1 year[PDat]` might be too narrow, but `last 5 years[PDat]` is often acceptable).\n        - Replace overly specific, non-standard synonyms with more general, widely accepted terms or MeSH terms if possible.\n        - Eliminate conversational language, redundant words, or overly complex nested parentheses if they don't add value.\n    5.  **Output:** Produce a single, clean, simplified query string ready for PubMed.\n\n    **Example:**\n    - **Complex Query:** `((((\"atrial fibrillation\"[MeSH Major Topic]) AND (\"subarachnoid hemorrhage\"[MeSH Major Topic] OR \"SAH\")) AND ((\"anticoagulants\"[MeSH Major Topic] OR \"warfarin\" OR \"dabigatran\" OR \"rivaroxaban\" OR \"apixaban\" OR \"edoxaban\"))) AND ((\"restarting\" OR \"timing\" OR \"reintroduction\" OR \"resumption\"))) AND (humans[MeSH]) AND ((\"systematic review\"[Publication Type] OR \"guideline\"[Publication Type])))`\n    - **Simplified Query:** `(\"atrial fibrillation\"[MeSH Major Topic] AND \"subarachnoid hemorrhage\"[MeSH Major Topic]) AND (anticoagulants[MeSH Major Topic] OR warfarin OR dabigatran OR rivaroxaban OR apixaban) AND (restarting OR timing OR reintroduction) AND (systematic review[PT] OR guideline[PT])`\n\n    Your goal is to create a query that an expert researcher would use: precise yet broad enough to capture the most relevant literature.\n\n    {{ ctx.output_format }}\n  \"#\n}\nfunction FormulateDeepResearchStrategy(input: ResearchTaskInput) -> FormulatedSearchStrategyOutput {\n  client DrCorvusLLM\n  prompt #\"\n    I am an expert in medical database search strategies and evidence-based research formulation.\n\n    Your task is to analyze the user's research question and formulate a comprehensive and effective search strategy.

This is the `refined_query_for_llm_synthesis`.\n    - Identify key concepts, synonyms, and MeSH terms from the expanded query.\n\n    **Step 2: Multi-Source Evidence Strategy Formulation**\n    **A) PubMed Database Search (Tier 1 - VERY Broad Initial Search for Maximum Recall):**\n    - Your ABSOLUTE PRIORITY for this first PubMed query is to maximize RECALL. Aim for a large set of potentially relevant articles. Precision is secondary at this stage.\n    - Construct a SIMPLE query using only 2-3 core concepts from the user's request (e.g., the main condition and primary intervention, or condition and key outcome).\n    - Use broad MeSH terms (`[MeSH]`) combined with general text word synonyms using OR.\n    - CRITICAL: Use a MAXIMUM of 1 (ONE) or at most 2 (TWO) `AND` clauses. Often, a single `AND` combining two broad concept groups is best.\n    - AVOID constructing queries with 3 or more `AND` clauses for this initial step, as it severely limits recall.\n    - Example for user query 'Quando reiniciar anticoagulante em paciente com FA e HSA?':\n        - *INCORRECT (too many ANDs for initial broad search):* `(atrial fibrillation[MeSH] OR AFib) AND (subarachnoid hemorrhage[MeSH] OR SAH) AND (anticoagulants[MeSH]) AND (timing OR restart)`\n        - *PREFERRED (example 1 - focus on condition & event):* `(atrial fibrillation[MeSH] OR AFib OR AF) AND (subarachnoid hemorrhage[MeSH] OR SAH)`\n        - *PREFERRED (example 2 - focus on event & intervention):* `(subarachnoid hemorrhage[MeSH] OR SAH) AND (anticoagulants[MeSH] OR warfarin) AND (timing OR restart)`\n    Choose the simpler form that best captures the core of the question for a wide initial net. Subsequent, more targeted searches can add precision.\n    - AVOID specific publication type filters like `systematic review[PT]` or `meta-analysis[PT]` in this *initial* broad query. If any publication filter is used, make it very general (e.g., `review[PT]` or `clinical study[PT]`) or omit it entirely.\n    - AVOID date filters unless the user's query is extremely time-sensitive (e.g., \"latest guidelines in the last year\").\n    - Syntax Example (VERY Broad Search): `(main_condition[MeSH] OR synonym_condition) AND (key_intervention_or_outcome[MeSH] OR synonym_intervention_or_outcome)` OR simply `(main_concept1[MeSH] OR synonym1) AND (main_concept2[MeSH] OR synonym2) AND (review[PT] OR clinical study[PT])`\n    - Rationale: This very broad search casts the widest possible net. Subsequent AI synthesis steps will filter and refine these results. We need more raw material first.\n    - CRITICAL: For all PubMed searches, ensure the `SearchParameters` object includes `language_filter: \"eng\"` AND `max_results: 20`.\n    \n    **B) Brave Web Search (for Guidelines & Current Information):**\n    - Target official medical society guidelines\n    - Search for recent consensus statements and position papers\n    - Include year markers (2025, 2024, 2023, 2022) for currency\n    - Target specific organizations (e.g., \"AHA guidelines\", \"ESC recommendations\", \"WHO guidelines\")\n    - Search patterns: \"[condition] guidelines 2025 [medical society]\", \"[intervention] consensus statement 2023\"\n    - Look for .org, .gov, and official medical society domains\n    - Include terms like \"clinical practice guidelines\", \"expert consensus\", \"position statement\"\n    - Aim to retrieve a comprehensive set of results: specify `max_results: 15` for Brave Web Search strategies.\n    \n    **C) Clinical Guidelines Lookup:**\n    - Search for evidence-based clinical guidelines from authoritative sources\n    - Target major medical societies, government health agencies, and international organizations\n    - Focus on recently updated guidelines (within last 2-3 years)\n    - Look for condition-specific and intervention-specific recommendations\n    - Aim for focused results: specify `max_results: 15` for Clinical Guideline Lookup strategies.\n    - CRITICAL: For these \"Clinical Guidelines Lookup\" strategies, ensure the `SearchParameters` object uses `source: GUIDELINE_RESOURCE`.\n\n    **D) Academic Google Scholar Search (for Broader Academic Scope):**\n    - Utilize Google Scholar to find a wide range of academic literature, including articles, theses, preprints, and abstracts from academic publishers, professional societies, online repositories, universities, and other scholarly websites.\n    - Formulate queries that are somewhat broader than PubMed queries, as Google Scholar's indexing is different. Keywords and key phrases are effective.\n    - Consider this source for finding emerging research or perspectives not yet in major databases.\n    - Aim for a moderate number of results: specify `max_results: 10` for Google Scholar search strategies.\n    - Ensure the `SearchParameters` object uses `source: ACADEMIC_GOOGLE_SCHOLAR`.\n\n    - For each strategy formulated in `search_parameters_list`, ensure the `SearchParameters` object is complete, including an appropriate `max_results` value as discussed (e.g., 20 for PubMed, 15 for Brave, 15 for Guidelines, 10 for Google Scholar).\n\n    3. **Source-Specific Optimization Strategies:**\n\n    **PubMed Advanced Techniques:**\n    - Use MeSH Major Topic [majr] for precision\n    - Combine publication types: [systematic review[PT] OR meta-analysis[PT] OR randomized controlled trial[PT]]\n    - Apply temporal restrictions intelligently\n    - Use field-specific searches: [tiab] for title/abstract, [au] for authors\n    \n    **Brave Search Best Practices:**\n    - Use specific medical terminology combined with \"guidelines\", \"consensus\", \"recommendations\"\n    - Include professional organizations: \"American College of Cardiology\", \"European Society of\", \"World Health Organization\"\n    - Add temporal qualifiers: \"updated 2024\", \"revised guidelines\", \"latest recommendations\"\n    - Target high-authority medical domains like: site:acc.org, site:escardio.org, site:who.int\n    - Search for specific document types: \"clinical practice guidelines PDF\", \"consensus statement\", \"position paper\"\n    \n    **Clinical Guidelines Strategy:**\n    - Query should target the specific condition or intervention\n    - Look for nationally and internationally recognized guidelines\n    - Prioritize evidence-based recommendations with clear grading systems\n    - Focus on guidelines from major medical societies relevant to the clinical question\n    - CRITICAL: When formulating parameters for this strategy, ensure the `SearchParameters` object uses `source: GUIDELINE_RESOURCE`.\n\n    4. **Quality and Evidence Hierarchy:**\n    - For treatment questions: Meta-analyses > RCTs > Prospective cohorts > Guidelines\n    - For diagnostic questions: Systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy > Prospective diagnostic studies\n    - For guidelines: Recent updates from major societies > Older recommendations\n    - Prioritize evidence from last 3-5 years unless seeking foundational studies\n\n    5. **Integrated Search Rationale:**\n    - Each search should complement the others:\n      - PubMed: Primary research evidence and systematic reviews\n      - Brave Search: Current guidelines, consensus statements, and emerging recommendations\n      - Guidelines Lookup: Authoritative clinical practice recommendations\n\n    **COMPREHENSIVE EXAMPLES:**\n\n    **For Heart Failure Management:**\n    - PubMed (VERY Broad Initial Search): \"(heart failure[MeSH] OR cardiac failure) AND (therapeutics[MeSH] OR drug therapy OR new treatments OR management)\"  // No specific publication types, very broad intervention/management terms\n    - Brave: \"heart failure guidelines 2024 AHA ACC ESC consensus recommendations management\"\n    - Guidelines: \"heart failure clinical practice guidelines evidence-based recommendations\"\n    - Google Scholar: \"heart failure management clinical guidelines 2024 AHA ACC ESC recommendations\"\n\n    **For Sepsis Management:**\n    - PubMed: \"(sepsis[MeSH Major Topic] OR septic shock[MeSH]) AND (fluid therapy[MeSH] OR vasopressor agents[MeSH]) AND (mortality[MeSH] OR organ dysfunction scores[MeSH]) AND humans[MeSH] AND (last 3 years[PDat] OR systematic review[PT])\"\n    - Brave: \"sepsis guidelines 2024 surviving sepsis campaign recommendations\"\n    - Guidelines: \"sepsis management clinical guidelines early goal-directed therapy\"\n    - Google Scholar: \"sepsis management clinical guidelines 2024 recommendations treatment\"\n    \n    **Now, apply this structured thinking to the user's query.**\n\n    {{ ctx.output_format }}\n  \"#\n}\n\nfunction AnalyzePDFDocument(input: PDFAnalysisInput) -> PDFAnalysisOutput {\n  client DrCorvusLLM\n  prompt #\"\n    {{ GetProfessionalIntroduction() }}\n    I am an expert in the critical analysis of medical and scientific documents.

ENHANCED RESEARCH TRANSPARENCY:**\n    - Document comprehensive search metrics.\n    - Be transparent about any limitations in the search process.\n    \n    **V. CLINICAL INTEGRATION AND IMPLICATIONS:**\n    - Provide detailed clinical practice recommendations.\n    - Discuss implementation considerations and practical barriers.\n    - Address different patient populations and clinical scenarios.\n    \n    **VI. RESEARCH GAPS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS:**\n    - Identify specific areas where evidence is insufficient.\n    - Suggest methodologically appropriate future research.\n    \n    **CRITICAL SYNTHESIS STANDARDS:**\n    - Use evidence grading: \"High\" (High-quality RCTs, systematic reviews), \"Moderate\" (good quality studies with some limitations), \"Low\" (observational studies, limited quality).\n    - Include quantitative data: effect sizes, confidence intervals, p-values, number needed to treat.\n    - Cite specific studies by author/journal when discussing key findings.\n    - Provide a balanced analysis including both benefits and harms.\n    - Apply principles from the Cochrane Handbook and GRADE guidelines.\n\n    **DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR 'relevant_references':**\n    For each reference included in the 'relevant_references' array, ensure the following fields are accurately populated:\n    - `reference_id`: Must be unique for each reference.\n    - `title`, `authors`, `journal`, `year`: Populate accurately from the source data.\n    - `doi`, `pmid`, `url`: Include if available in the source data.\n    - `study_type`: Accurately reflect the type of study.\n    - `snippet_or_abstract`: THIS IS CRITICAL. Populate this field.\n        - If the input `RawSearchResultItem` for the reference contains an 'abstract' field, use its content directly.\n        - If the 'abstract' is missing, but you can generate a concise and relevant summary (1-3 sentences) from the title and other available information (like key findings related to this reference, if discernible), create such a snippet.\n        - If no abstract or suitable snippet can be derived, this field can be null, but strive to provide it.\n    - `relevance_score`: THIS IS CRITICAL. For each reference you include in the output, ensure its `relevance_score` field (a float value between 0.0 and 1.0) accurately reflects its importance to the `original_query` *after* your deep synthesis.\n        - If the input `RawSearchResultItem` has an initial 'relevance_score', use this as a starting point.\n        - Critically evaluate the reference's actual contribution. Your final `relevance_score` for the outputted reference should be based on your comprehensive analysis, potentially adjusting the initial score.\n        - This score must reflect how directly and significantly the reference addresses the 'original_query'.\n\n    **FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT:**\n    Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the output schema.\n\n\n    {{ ctx.output_format }}\n  \"#\n}\n\n// Enhanced Evidence Analysis Pipeline for Dr. Corvus\n\n// --- Enums and Core Classes ---\n\nenum StudyDesignType {\n  RCT

If it is high, reduce 1 or 2 levels in quality.\n        - **Inconsistency:** (Usually requires comparison with other studies, but can be inferred if the `key_results` are contradictory).\n        - **Indirectness:** Is the population, intervention, or outcomes (`population`, `interventions`, `primary_outcomes`) of the study very different from the general clinical question? If so, reduce 1 level.\n        - **Imprecisão:** The `key_results` show very wide confidence intervals? The `sample_size` is very small? If so, reduce 1 level.\n\n    3.  **Upgrade (Aumentar a Qualidade, raro):** The study shows a large effect size or a strong dose-response relationship? If so, it can increase 1 level.\n\n    4.  **Força da Recomendação:** Based on the `overall_quality` final, evaluate the strength of the recommendation.\n        - **FORTE:** High or moderate quality, with clear benefits outweighing risks.\n        - **FRACA:** Low or very low quality, or when benefits and risks are balanced or uncertain.\n\n    5.  **Bias Analysis and Recommendations:** Fill the bias analysis and formulate practical recommendations for the clinician.\n\n    Based on your analysis, fill the `EvidenceAppraisalOutput` object.\n\n    {{ ctx.output_format }}\n  \"\"\"#\n}\n\n// --- PICO Question Formulation ---\nfunction FormulateEvidenceBasedPICOQuestion(input: ClinicalScenarioInput) -> PICOFormulationOutput {\n  client DrCorvusLLM\n  prompt #\"\n    {{ GetProfessionalIntroduction() }}\n    You are an expert in Evidence-Based Medicine and structured PICO question formulation.\n\n    Your task is to analyze the provided clinical scenario and transform it into a well-structured PICO question to facilitate evidence search.\n\n    CLINICAL SCENARIO PROVIDED:\n    {{ input.clinical_scenario }}\n    {% if input.additional_context %}\n    ADDITIONAL CONTEXT: {{ input.additional_context }}\n    {% endif %}\n\n    **PICO FORMULATION PROCESS WITH DETAILED REASONING:**\n\n    FIRST, execute a systematic Chain-of-Thought analysis to identify each PICO component:\n\n    **1. SCENARIO ANALYSIS:**\n    - Identify key elements of the clinical scenario\n    - Recognize the type of clinical question (therapy, diagnosis, prognosis, etiology, etc.)\n    - Consider context and mentioned limitations\n\n    **2. SYSTEMATIC IDENTIFICATION OF PICO ELEMENTS:**\n\n    **P (Population/Patient/Problem):**\n    - Who are the specific patients?\n    - What relevant demographic characteristics? (age, sex, comorbidities)\n    - What is the main clinical condition?\n    - Are there implicit inclusion/exclusion criteria?\n\n    **I (Intervention):**\n    - What is the intervention, treatment, diagnostic test, or exposure being considered?\n    - Is it pharmacological, surgical, diagnostic, or preventive intervention?\n    - Are there specifications for dose, duration, technique?\n\n    **C (Comparison):**\n    - What is the intervention being compared to?\n    - Is it placebo, standard treatment, no intervention, or another intervention?\n    - Is the comparison explicit or implicit in the scenario?\n\n    **O (Outcome):**\n    - What is the clinical outcome of interest?\n    - Is it a primary outcome (mortality, morbidity) or secondary (quality of life)?\n    - Are there safety outcomes to consider?\n\n    **T (Time - if applicable):**\n    - What is the relevant follow-up period?\n    - Are there specific temporal considerations?\n\n    **S (Study Type - if applicable):**\n    - What type of study would be most appropriate to answer this question?\n\n    **3. QUESTION FORMULATION:**\n    - Combine PICO elements into a clear and searchable question\n    - Use precise and standardized medical terminology\n    - Ensure the question is specific enough to be searchable, but not so restrictive as to limit results\n\n    **4. SEARCH STRATEGY:**\n    - Propose key search terms, preferably in English for international databases\n    - Include MeSH terms when applicable\n    - Suggest Boolean combinations (AND, OR, NOT) that reflect the formulated PICO question\n    - Consider synonyms and terminological variations\n\n    **5. RECOMMENDED STUDY TYPES:**\n    - Based on the PICO question, what study types would be most appropriate?\n    - Consider the evidence hierarchy for the question type\n\n    **IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**\n    - Use precise and appropriate medical terminology\n    - Always respond in English, regardless of the scenario language\n    - Be specific enough to be searchable, but not so restrictive as to limit results\n    - Consider different study types that could answer the question\n    - If the scenario allows multiple interpretations, offer alternative formulations\n    - Your final response must be IN PORTUGUESE AND MATCHING THE OUTPUT FORMAT.\n\n    **EXAMPLE PROCESS:**\n    Scenario: \"Diabetic patient with chest pain\"\n    \n    Reasoning:\n    - P: Adults with diabetes mellitus (specific characteristics: age, diabetes type, comorbidities)\n    - I: Exercise stress test (diagnostic intervention)\n    - C: Resting electrocardiogram (diagnostic comparator)\n    - O: Detection of coronary artery disease (diagnostic outcome)\n    \n    Question: \"In adults with diabetes mellitus (P), does exercise stress testing (I) compared to resting electrocardiogram (C) have greater effectiveness in detecting coronary artery disease (O)?\"\n\n    **IMPORTANT ABOUT RESPONSE FIELDS:**\n    \n    - **pico_derivation_reasoning**: Include your detailed thought process for identifying each PICO component, explaining how you arrived at each element from the provided scenario.\n    \n    - **explanation**: Provide a clear and educational explanation of how the PICO question was formulated, suitable for students and professionals.\n    \n    - **search_terms_suggestions**: List key terms in English, including MeSH terms when applicable, that would be useful for searching evidence on this question.\n    \n    - **boolean_search_strategies**: Suggest specific combinations using Boolean operators (e.g., \"(diabetes mellitus OR diabetes) AND (chest pain OR angina) AND (exercise test OR stress test)\").\n    \n    - **alternative_pico_formulations**: If the scenario allows different interpretations or approaches, offer alternative PICO question formulations.\n    \n    - **recommended_study_types**: Based on the PICO question type, indicate which study types would be most appropriate (e.g., RCT for therapy, cohort studies for prognosis,

quality dimensions\n       - Assess source coverage limitations\n       - Evaluate deduplication efficiency issues\n\n    2. **Source Strategy Enhancement:**\n       - Add complementary sources for coverage gaps\n       - Optimize queries for underperforming sources\n       - Include specialized databases if needed\n\n    3. **Query Refinement:**\n       - Improve search terms for precision\n       - Add MeSH terms or specialized vocabularies\n       - Optimize boolean logic for better retrieval\n\n    4. **Quality Improvement Strategies:**\n       - Target high-impact journals specifically\n       - Include temporal filters for recency\n       - Add study type filters for evidence quality\n\n    5. **Efficiency Optimization:**\n       - Reduce overlap between sources\n       - Optimize search parameters for speed\n       - Implement smart filtering strategies\n\n    **OPTIMIZATION TARGETS:**\n\n    **If Coverage Score < 0.7:**\n    - Add Europe PMC for full-text coverage\n    - Include Lens.org for comprehensive academic content\n    - Add specialized medical databases\n\n    **If Diversity Score < 0.6:**\n    - Include preprint servers (medRxiv, bioRxiv)\n    - Add clinical guidelines databases\n    - Include grey literature sources\n\n    **If Deduplication Rate > 0.4:**\n    - Refine queries to reduce overlap\n    - Use more specific search terms\n    - Implement source-specific strategies\n\n    **If Quality Score < 0.7:**\n    - Focus on high-impact journals\n    - Add temporal restrictions for recency\n    - Include systematic review filters\n\n    {{
