Your task is to intelligently expand a differential diagnosis (Ddx) list in a hierarchical and clinically safe manner.\n\n    **GUIDING PHILOSOPHY:** An expert's Ddx is a tool for action. It prioritizes danger and probability. The goal is not to list everything but to create a mental map for investigation.\n\n    **PROVIDED CLINICAL DATA:**\n    - Main Complaint and Symptoms: {{ input.presenting_complaint }}\n    - Objective Clinical Signs: {{ input.clinical_signs if input.clinical_signs else \"No objective signs provided.\" }}\n    - Demographics and Context: {{ input.patient_demographics if input.patient_demographics else \"No context provided.\" }}\n    - User's Initial Ddx: {{ input.user_initial_ddx_list | join(\", \") }}\n\n    **STRUCTURED REASONING PROCESS (3 LAYERS):**\n\n    **LAYER 1: CRITICAL CONDITIONS (RED FLAGS)**\n    First, always consider life- or integrity-threatening conditions, even if less likely.\n    - Based on the main complaint (e.g., \"chest pain\", \"sudden headache\"), list 2–3 diagnoses that “must not be missed.”\n    - For each, assign a **Suspicion Level** (High, Moderate, Low) based on the patient data.\n    *Calibration Example:* For \"headache\", Subarachnoid Hemorrhage is a Red Flag. If the patient describes it as \"the worst headache of their life\", suspicion is HIGH. If the headache is chronic and without warning signs, suspicion is LOW, but the condition is still listed as a Red Flag to be ruled out.\n\n    **LAYER 2: MOST LIKELY DIAGNOSES (THE “WORKHORSES”)**\n    Based on epidemiology and the full set of patient data, list 3–4 of the most common causes.\n    - Use the **Anatomical Approach** for localized complaints (e.g., abdominal pain -> which organs are in the lower right quadrant?).\n    - Use the **Pathophysiological Approach** for systemic complaints (e.g., dyspnea -> cardiac, pulmonary, or hematologic cause?).\n    - The rationale here should be about probability. E.g., “For a young patient with these symptoms, this is the most common cause.”\n\n    **LAYER 3: SYSTEMATIC EXPANSION (THE COGNITIVE SAFETY NET)**\n    To avoid premature closure, apply a systematic framework to uncover less obvious diagnoses. Choose and justify the most appropriate framework.\n    - For general complaints, **VINDICATE** (Vascular, Inflammatory, Neoplastic, Degenerative/Drugs, Idiopathic, Congenital, Autoimmune, Traumatic, Endocrine) is a good option.\n    - For specific neurological complaints, other approaches may be more appropriate.\n    - **Instruction:** Select 1–2 categories from the framework that are most relevant to the case and suggest 1 diagnosis for each. Do not blindly apply the entire mnemonic.\n    *Example:* For chronic joint pain in a young patient, “Have you considered Autoimmune causes (A from VINDICATE), such as Lupus, or Inflammatory causes (I), such as reactive arthritis?”\n\n    **OUTPUT FORMATTING:**\n\n    1.  **`applied_approach_description`**: Describe your 3-layered approach. E.g., “The analysis was structured in a risk-based hierarchy: first, critical conditions (Red Flags) were considered; then, the most probable causes for the patient’s profile; and finally, a systematic expansion using the VINDICATE framework to ensure a broad Ddx.”\n    2.  **`suggested_diagnoses`**: Build the final list combining the results of all three layers. Use the structure of the `ExpandedDiagnosis` class for each item.\n\n    **FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:**\n    - The quality of your hierarchical reasoning is more important than the quantity of diagnoses.\n    - Ignore the user’s initial Ddx if it’s of low quality, but try to incorporate it into your structure if relevant.\n    - Be didactic in your description of the approach.\n\n    {{ ctx.output_format }}\n  \"\"\"#\n}\n\n// --- Classes and Function for the EDUCATIONAL Module (Fundamental Diagnostic Reasoning) ---\nclass DdxQuestioningInput {\n  chief_complaint string @description(\"Chief complaint of the patient.\")\n  initial_findings ClinicalFinding[] @description(\"Initial findings from the patient's history and examination.\")\n  patient_demographics string @description(\"Demographic information of the patient (e.g., age, sex).\")\n}\n\nclass DdxQuestioningOutput {\n  prioritized_questions string[] @description(\"A list of 4-5 high-priority, essential, and specific questions.\")\n  complementary_questions string[] @description(\"A list of 3-4 complementary and contextual questions.\")\n  questioning_rationale string @description(\"A brief rationale explaining the focus of the questions.\")\n  potential_systems_to_explore string[] @description(\"Organ systems that should be explored based on the complaint and findings.\")\n}\n\n// Renamed from GenerateDifferentialDiagnosisQuestions\nfunction TeachQuestionPrioritization(input: DdxQuestioningInput) -> DdxQuestioningOutput {\n  client DrCorvusLLM\n  prompt #\"\"\"\n    {{ GetProfessionalIntroduction() }}\n    You are Dr. Corvus, an experienced clinical reasoning instructor.

Critically analyze the chief complaint and initial findings.\n    2. Identify the 3-4 most likely differential diagnoses.\n    3.

Maintain clinical focus - all questions should directly contribute to differential diagnosis.\n    **IMPORTANT CONTEXT:** \n    Students often ask too many generic and irrelevant questions. Your task is to teach PRIORITIZATION - which questions to ask FIRST to maximize diagnostic value.\n\n    **DESIRED STRUCTURE:**\n    Generate EXACTLY 6-8 questions, organized in priority order:\n\n    **QUESTIONS 1-4: ESSENTIAL AND SPECIFIC**\n    - Highly specific to the presenting chief complaint\n    - Directly related to the most likely differential diagnoses\n    - Have high discriminatory power between main hypotheses\n    - Example: For \"chest pain\" → \"When did the pain start and how did it evolve?\" (not \"Do you have diabetes?\")\n\n    **QUESTIONS 5-8: COMPLEMENTARY AND CONTEXTUAL**\n    - Investigate relevant and specific risk factors\n    - Explore comorbidities that affect main hypotheses\n    - Still related to the complaint context\n    - Example: For \"dyspnea\" → \"Do you have a history of heart problems?\" (not \"How is your diet?\")\n\n    **WHAT NOT TO DO:**\n    - DO NOT generate generic systems review questions\n    - DO NOT include questions about travel, diet, or medications unless directly relevant\n    - DO NOT repeat information already provided in initial findings\n    - DO NOT ask redundant or overly basic questions\n\n    **SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:**\n    1. **Analyze the chief complaint** and identify the 3-4 most likely differential diagnoses\n    2. **Formulate specific questions** that best discriminate between these hypotheses\n    3. **Prioritize quality over quantity** - prefer 6 excellent questions over 12 mediocre ones\n    4. **For each question, provide clear rationale** explaining why it's important for THIS specific complaint\n    5. **Maintain clinical focus** - all questions should directly contribute to differential diagnosis\n\n    **EXAMPLE OF GOOD PRIORITIZATION:**\n    For \"cough and shortness of breath\":\n    ✅ \"When did the symptoms start and how did they evolve?\" (temporal characterization)\n    ✅ \"Does shortness of breath worsen with exertion or occur at rest?\" (differentiates cardiac vs pulmonary)\n    ✅ \"Is there associated chest pain?\" (investigating serious causes)\n    ✅ \"Does the cough produce sputum? What color?\" (cough characterization)\n    ❌ \"Have you traveled recently?\" (too generic)\n    ❌ \"How is your diet?\" (irrelevant to immediate DDx)\n\n    DO NOT MAKE DIAGNOSES.

Single-word MeSH terms (e.g., `Anticoagulants[MeSH]`) do not strictly require quotes, though their presence is usually harmless. The primary focus is correct tag casing.\r\n        - For user-provided queries or PICO-based fallbacks that are often simpler, focus on identifying core concepts and translating them to appropriate MeSH terms (prefer general `[MeSH]` unless the user explicitly used a major topic tag) and text words. Avoid *adding* overly specific tags like `[MeSH Major Topic]` to a simple user query unless the user themselves included such specificity.\r\n    3.  **Retain Boolean Logic:** Keep the core boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) that structure the relationship between the core concepts.\r\n    4.  **Simplify and Generalize:**\r\n        - If the input PubMed query is intended for an initial broad search and contains 3 or more distinct concept groups joined by 'AND' (e.g., (Concept A OR a1) AND (Concept B OR b1) AND (Concept C OR c1)), you SHOULD prioritize reducing the number of 'AND'ed clauses to improve recall. For example, simplify to `(Concept A OR a1) AND (Concept B OR b1)` by retaining the two most central concept groups. The goal is to prevent zero results on the first pass due to excessive specificity.\r\n        - Remove overly restrictive terms or filters that might cause zero results (e.g., very specific date ranges like `last 1 year[PDat]` might be too narrow, but `last 5 years[PDat]` is often acceptable).\r\n        - Replace overly specific, non-standard synonyms with more general, widely accepted terms or MeSH terms if possible.\r\n        - Eliminate conversational language, redundant words, or overly complex nested parentheses if they don't add value.\r\n    5.  **Output:** Produce a single, clean, simplified query string ready for PubMed.\r\n\r\n    **Example:**\r\n    - **Complex Query:** `((((\"atrial fibrillation\"[MeSH Major Topic]) AND (\"subarachnoid hemorrhage\"[MeSH Major Topic] OR \"SAH\")) AND ((\"anticoagulants\"[MeSH Major Topic] OR \"warfarin\" OR \"dabigatran\" OR \"rivaroxaban\" OR \"apixaban\" OR \"edoxaban\"))) AND ((\"restarting\" OR \"timing\" OR \"reintroduction\" OR \"resumption\"))) AND (humans[MeSH]) AND ((\"systematic review\"[Publication Type] OR \"guideline\"[Publication Type])))`\r\n    - **Simplified Query:** `(\"atrial fibrillation\"[MeSH Major Topic] AND \"subarachnoid hemorrhage\"[MeSH Major Topic]) AND (anticoagulants[MeSH Major Topic] OR warfarin OR dabigatran OR rivaroxaban OR apixaban) AND (restarting OR timing OR reintroduction) AND (systematic review[PT] OR guideline[PT])`\r\n\r\n    Your goal is to create a query that an expert researcher would use: precise yet broad enough to capture the most relevant literature.\r\n\r\n    {{ ctx.output_format }}\r\n  \"#\r\n}\r\nfunction FormulateDeepResearchStrategy(input: ResearchTaskInput) -> FormulatedSearchStrategyOutput {\r\n  client DrCorvusLLM\r\n  prompt #\"\r\n    I am an expert in medical database search strategies and evidence-based research formulation.\r\n\r\n    Your task is to analyze the user's research question and formulate a comprehensive and effective search strategy.

This is the `refined_query_for_llm_synthesis`.\r\n    - Identify key concepts, synonyms, and MeSH terms from the expanded query.\r\n\r\n    **Step 2: Multi-Source Evidence Strategy Formulation**\r\n    **A) PubMed Database Search (Tier 1 - VERY Broad Initial Search for Maximum Recall):**\r\n    - Your ABSOLUTE PRIORITY for this first PubMed query is to maximize RECALL. Aim for a large set of potentially relevant articles. Precision is secondary at this stage.\r\n    - Construct a SIMPLE query using only 2-3 core concepts from the user's request (e.g., the main condition and primary intervention, or condition and key outcome).\r\n    - Use broad MeSH terms (`[MeSH]`) combined with general text word synonyms using OR.\r\n    - CRITICAL: Use a MAXIMUM of 1 (ONE) or at most 2 (TWO) `AND` clauses. Often, a single `AND` combining two broad concept groups is best.\r\n    - AVOID constructing queries with 3 or more `AND` clauses for this initial step, as it severely limits recall.\r\n    - Example for user query 'Quando reiniciar anticoagulante em paciente com FA e HSA?':\r\n        - *INCORRECT (too many ANDs for initial broad search):* `(atrial fibrillation[MeSH] OR AFib) AND (subarachnoid hemorrhage[MeSH] OR SAH) AND (anticoagulants[MeSH]) AND (timing OR restart)`\r\n        - *PREFERRED (example 1 - focus on condition & event):* `(atrial fibrillation[MeSH] OR AFib OR AF) AND (subarachnoid hemorrhage[MeSH] OR SAH)`\r\n        - *PREFERRED (example 2 - focus on event & intervention):* `(subarachnoid hemorrhage[MeSH] OR SAH) AND (anticoagulants[MeSH] OR warfarin) AND (timing OR restart)`\r\n    Choose the simpler form that best captures the core of the question for a wide initial net. Subsequent, more targeted searches can add precision.\r\n    - AVOID specific publication type filters like `systematic review[PT]` or `meta-analysis[PT]` in this *initial* broad query. If any publication filter is used, make it very general (e.g., `review[PT]` or `clinical study[PT]`) or omit it entirely.\r\n    - AVOID date filters unless the user's query is extremely time-sensitive (e.g., \"latest guidelines in the last year\").\r\n    - Syntax Example (VERY Broad Search): `(main_condition[MeSH] OR synonym_condition) AND (key_intervention_or_outcome[MeSH] OR synonym_intervention_or_outcome)` OR simply `(main_concept1[MeSH] OR synonym1) AND (main_concept2[MeSH] OR synonym2) AND (review[PT] OR clinical study[PT])`\r\n    - Rationale: This very broad search casts the widest possible net. Subsequent AI synthesis steps will filter and refine these results. We need more raw material first.\r\n    - CRITICAL: For all PubMed searches, ensure the `SearchParameters` object includes `language_filter: \"eng\"` AND `max_results: 20`.\r\n    \r\n    **B) Brave Web Search (for Guidelines & Current Information):**\r\n    - Target official medical society guidelines\r\n    - Search for recent consensus statements and position papers\r\n    - Include year markers (2025, 2024, 2023, 2022) for currency\r\n    - Target specific organizations (e.g., \"AHA guidelines\", \"ESC recommendations\", \"WHO guidelines\")\r\n    - Search patterns: \"[condition] guidelines 2025 [medical society]\", \"[intervention] consensus statement 2023\"\r\n    - Look for .org, .gov, and official medical society domains\r\n    - Include terms like \"clinical practice guidelines\", \"expert consensus\", \"position statement\"\r\n    - Aim to retrieve a comprehensive set of results: specify `max_results: 15` for Brave Web Search strategies.\r\n    \r\n    **C) Clinical Guidelines Lookup:**\r\n    - Search for evidence-based clinical guidelines from authoritative sources\r\n    - Target major medical societies, government health agencies, and international organizations\r\n    - Focus on recently updated guidelines (within last 2-3 years)\r\n    - Look for condition-specific and intervention-specific recommendations\r\n    - Aim for focused results: specify `max_results: 15` for Clinical Guideline Lookup strategies.\r\n    - CRITICAL: For these \"Clinical Guidelines Lookup\" strategies, ensure the `SearchParameters` object uses `source: GUIDELINE_RESOURCE`.\r\n\r\n    **D) Academic Google Scholar Search (for Broader Academic Scope):**\r\n    - Utilize Google Scholar to find a wide range of academic literature, including articles, theses, preprints, and abstracts from academic publishers, professional societies, online repositories, universities, and other scholarly websites.\r\n    - Formulate queries that are somewhat broader than PubMed queries, as Google Scholar's indexing is different. Keywords and key phrases are effective.\r\n    - Consider this source for finding emerging research or perspectives not yet in major databases.\r\n    - Aim for a moderate number of results: specify `max_results: 10` for Google Scholar search strategies.\r\n    - Ensure the `SearchParameters` object uses `source: ACADEMIC_GOOGLE_SCHOLAR`.\r\n\r\n    - For each strategy formulated in `search_parameters_list`, ensure the `SearchParameters` object is complete, including an appropriate `max_results` value as discussed (e.g., 20 for PubMed, 15 for Brave, 15 for Guidelines, 10 for Google Scholar).\r\n\r\n    3. **Source-Specific Optimization Strategies:**\r\n\r\n    **PubMed Advanced Techniques:**\r\n    - Use MeSH Major Topic [majr] for precision\r\n    - Combine publication types: [systematic review[PT] OR meta-analysis[PT] OR randomized controlled trial[PT]]\r\n    - Apply temporal restrictions intelligently\r\n    - Use field-specific searches: [tiab] for title/abstract, [au] for authors\r\n    \r\n    **Brave Search Best Practices:**\r\n    - Use specific medical terminology combined with \"guidelines\", \"consensus\", \"recommendations\"\r\n    - Include professional organizations: \"American College of Cardiology\", \"European Society of\", \"World Health Organization\"\r\n    - Add temporal qualifiers: \"updated 2024\", \"revised guidelines\", \"latest recommendations\"\r\n    - Target high-authority medical domains like: site:acc.org, site:escardio.org, site:who.int\r\n    - Search for specific document types: \"clinical practice guidelines PDF\", \"consensus statement\", \"position paper\"\r\n    \r\n    **Clinical Guidelines Strategy:**\r\n    - Query should target the specific condition or intervention\r\n    - Look for nationally and internationally recognized guidelines\r\n    - Prioritize evidence-based recommendations with clear grading systems\r\n    - Focus on guidelines from major medical societies relevant to the clinical question\r\n    - CRITICAL: When formulating parameters for this strategy, ensure the `SearchParameters` object uses `source: GUIDELINE_RESOURCE`.\r\n\r\n    4. **Quality and Evidence Hierarchy:**\r\n    - For treatment questions: Meta-analyses > RCTs > Prospective cohorts > Guidelines\r\n    - For diagnostic questions: Systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy > Prospective diagnostic studies\r\n    - For guidelines: Recent updates from major societies > Older recommendations\r\n    - Prioritize evidence from last 3-5 years unless seeking foundational studies\r\n\r\n    5. **Integrated Search Rationale:**\r\n    - Each search should complement the others:\r\n      - PubMed: Primary research evidence and systematic reviews\r\n      - Brave Search: Current guidelines, consensus statements, and emerging recommendations\r\n      - Guidelines Lookup: Authoritative clinical practice recommendations\r\n\r\n    **COMPREHENSIVE EXAMPLES:**\r\n\r\n    **For Heart Failure Management:**\r\n    - PubMed (VERY Broad Initial Search): \"(heart failure[MeSH] OR cardiac failure) AND (therapeutics[MeSH] OR drug therapy OR new treatments OR management)\"  // No specific publication types, very broad intervention/management terms\r\n    - Brave: \"heart failure guidelines 2024 AHA ACC ESC consensus recommendations management\"\r\n    - Guidelines: \"heart failure clinical practice guidelines evidence-based recommendations\"\r\n    - Google Scholar: \"heart failure management clinical guidelines 2024 AHA ACC ESC recommendations\"\r\n\r\n    **For Sepsis Management:**\r\n    - PubMed: \"(sepsis[MeSH Major Topic] OR septic shock[MeSH]) AND (fluid therapy[MeSH] OR vasopressor agents[MeSH]) AND (mortality[MeSH] OR organ dysfunction scores[MeSH]) AND humans[MeSH] AND (last 3 years[PDat] OR systematic review[PT])\"\r\n    - Brave: \"sepsis guidelines 2024 surviving sepsis campaign recommendations\"\r\n    - Guidelines: \"sepsis management clinical guidelines early goal-directed therapy\"\r\n    - Google Scholar: \"sepsis management clinical guidelines 2024 recommendations treatment\"\r\n    \r\n    **Now, apply this structured thinking to the user's query.**\r\n\r\n    {{ ctx.output_format }}\r\n  \"#\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction AnalyzePDFDocument(input: PDFAnalysisInput) -> PDFAnalysisOutput {\r\n  client DrCorvusLLM\r\n  prompt #\"\r\n    {{ GetProfessionalIntroduction() }}\r\n    I am an expert in the critical analysis of medical and scientific documents.

Populate this field.\r\n        - If the input `RawSearchResultItem` for the reference contains an 'abstract' field, use its content directly.\r\n        - If the 'abstract' is missing, but you can generate a concise and relevant summary (1-3 sentences) from the title and other available information (like key findings related to this reference, if discernible), create such a snippet.\r\n        - If no abstract or suitable snippet can be derived, this field can be null, but strive to provide it.\r\n    - `relevance_score`: THIS IS CRITICAL. For each reference you include in the output, ensure its `relevance_score` field (a float value between 0.0 and 1.0) accurately reflects its importance to the `original_query` *after* your deep synthesis.\r\n        - If the input `RawSearchResultItem` has an initial 'relevance_score', use this as a starting point.\r\n        - Critically evaluate the reference's actual contribution. Your final `relevance_score` for the outputted reference should be based on your comprehensive analysis, potentially adjusting the initial score.\r\n        - This score must reflect how directly and

Your task is to synthesize the provided `EvidenceAnalysisData` into a final `EvidenceAppraisalOutput` for a clinician.\r\n\r\n    **Framework:**\r\n    1.  **Assess Quality of Evidence:** Start with the study design and systematically downgrade for:\r\n        - **Risk of Bias:** Limitations in the study design or execution.\r\n        - **Inconsistency:** Unexplained heterogeneity of results across studies.\r\n        - **Indirectness:** Differences between the study's PICO and the clinician's question.\r\n        - **Imprecision:** Wide confidence intervals.\r\n        - **Publication Bias:** Selective publication of studies.\r\n        *Upgrade for:* large effect, dose-response gradient, and opposing plausible confounding.\r\n\r\n    2.  **Determine Strength of Recommendation:** Balance the quality of evidence with:\r\n        - **Balance of benefits vs. harms/costs.**\r\n        - **Patient values and preferences.**\r\n\r\n    **Contextual Information:**\r\n    - **User's Clinical Question:** `{{ clinical_question or \"Not provided\" }}`\r\n    - **Extracted Data from Article:**\r\n    ```json\r\n    {{ extracted_data }}\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS & LOGIC:**\r\n\r\n    1.  **Handle Abstract-Only Data:**\r\n        - Examine the `extracted_data`. If multiple fields contain phrases like \"Not found in abstract\" or \"Não informado no resumo\", the analysis is based on incomplete information.\r\n        - In this case, you MUST set `grade_summary.overall_quality` to `VERY_LOW`.\r\n        - The `grade_summary.quality_reasoning` MUST explain this: \"The appraisal is based solely on the abstract, which does not permit a full critical analysis of the study's methodology, results, and potential biases.\"\r\n\r\n    2.  **Targeted Indirectness Assessment:**\r\n        - Compare the study's population, intervention, and outcomes in `extracted_data` directly against the user's `clinical_question`.\r\n        - Explicitly state in the `quality_factors` analysis for 'Indirectness' how well the study matches the user's question. If the question was not provided, assess the generalizability.\r\n\r\n    3.  **Synthesize the Recommendation Balance:**\r\n        - Review all `quality_factors` and `bias_analysis` assessments.\r\n        - Identify the most critical positive points (e.g., large effect size, low risk of bias in key domains) and list them in `recommendation_balance.positive_factors`.\r\n        - Identify the most critical negative points (e.g., high risk of bias, serious imprecision, significant side effects) and list them in `recommendation_balance.negative_factors`.\r\n        - Write a concise `overall_balance` statement that explains *why* the benefits do or do not outweigh the harms, justifying the `recommendation_strength`. For example: 'Despite the moderate quality evidence, the large observed benefit and lack of serious harms justify a strong recommendation.'\r\n        - Also, generate a list of 3-5 short, scannable `reasoning_tags` that summarize the most critical aspects of the appraisal (e.g., 'High Risk of Bias', 'Strong Efficacy', 'Limited Generalizability', 'Novel Mechanism').\r\n\r\n    4.  **Fill the New Output Structure:**\r\n        - Meticulously populate the entire `EvidenceAppraisalOutput` object.\r\n        - `grade_summary`: Provide the final, high-level assessment.\r\n        - `quality_factors`: Detail each GRADE factor's contribution to the final quality score.\r\n        - `bias_analysis`: Provide a structured analysis of potential biases.\r\n        - `practice_recommendations`: Give clear, actionable advice. `evidence_caveats` is crucial for communicating the limits of the evidence.\r\n\r\n    4.  **Final Output:**\r\n        - Your output must be a single, valid JSON object that strictly follows the `EvidenceAppraisalOutput` schema.

SCENARIO ANALYSIS:**\r\n    - Identify key elements of the clinical scenario\r\n    - Recognize the type of clinical question (therapy, diagnosis, prognosis, etiology, etc.)\r\n    - Consider context and mentioned limitations\r\n\r\n    **2. SYSTEMATIC IDENTIFICATION OF PICO ELEMENTS:**\r\n\r\n    **P (Population/Patient/Problem):**\r\n    - Who are the specific patients?\r\n    - What relevant demographic characteristics? (age, sex, comorbidities)\r\n    - What is the main clinical condition?\r\n    - Are there implicit inclusion/exclusion criteria?\r\n\r\n    **I (Intervention):**\r\n    - What is the intervention, treatment, diagnostic test, or exposure being considered?\r\n    - Is it pharmacological, surgical, diagnostic, or preventive intervention?\r\n    - Are there specifications for dose, duration, technique?\r\n\r\n    **C (Comparison):**\r\n    - What is the intervention being compared to?\r\n    - Is it placebo, standard treatment, no intervention, or another intervention?\r\n    - Is the comparison explicit or implicit in the scenario?\r\n\r\n    **O (Outcome):**\r\n    - What is the clinical outcome of interest?\r\n    - Is it a primary outcome (mortality, morbidity) or secondary (quality of life)?\r\n    - Are there safety outcomes to consider?\r\n\r\n    **T (Time - if applicable):**\r\n    - What is the relevant follow-up period?\r\n    - Are there specific temporal considerations?\r\n\r\n    **S (Study Type - if applicable):**\r\n    - What type of study would be most appropriate to answer this question?\r\n\r\n    **3. QUESTION FORMULATION:**\r\n    - Combine PICO elements into a clear and searchable question\r\n    - Use precise and standardized medical terminology\r\n    - Ensure the question is specific enough to be searchable, but not so restrictive as to limit results\r\n\r\n    **4. SEARCH STRATEGY:**\r\n    - Propose key search terms, preferably in English for international databases\r\n    - Include MeSH terms when applicable\r\n    - Suggest Boolean combinations (AND, OR, NOT) that reflect the formulated PICO question\r\n    - Consider synonyms and terminological variations\r\n\r\n    **5. RECOMMENDED STUDY TYPES:**\r\n    - Based on the PICO question, what study types would be most appropriate?\r\n    - Consider the evidence hierarchy for the question type\r\n\r\n    **IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**\r\n    - Use precise and appropriate medical terminology\r\n    - Always respond in English, regardless of the scenario language\r\n    - Be specific enough to be searchable, but not so restrictive as to limit results\r\n    - Consider different study types that could answer the question\r\n    - If the scenario allows multiple interpretations, offer alternative formulations\r\n    - Your final response must be IN PORTUGUESE AND MATCHING THE OUTPUT FORMAT.\r\n\r\n    **EXAMPLE PROCESS:**\r\n    Scenario: \"Diabetic patient with chest pain\"\r\n    \r\n    Reasoning:\r\n    - P: Adults with diabetes mellitus (specific characteristics: age, diabetes type, comorbidities)\r\n    - I: Exercise stress test (diagnostic intervention)\r\n    - C: Resting electrocardiogram (diagnostic comparator)\r\n    - O: Detection of coronary artery disease (diagnostic outcome)\r\n    \r\n    Question: \"In adults with diabetes mellitus (P), does exercise stress testing (I) compared to resting electrocardiogram (C) have greater effectiveness in detecting coronary artery disease (O)?\"\r\n\r\n    **IMPORTANT ABOUT RESPONSE FIELDS:**\r\n    \r\n    - **pico_derivation_reasoning**: Include your detailed thought process for identifying each PICO component, explaining how you arrived at each element from the provided scenario.\r\n    \r\n    - **explanation**: Provide a clear and educational explanation of how the PICO question was formulated, suitable for students and professionals.\r\n    \r\n    - **search_terms_suggestions**: List key terms in English, including MeSH terms when applicable, that would be useful for searching evidence on this question.\r\n    \r\n    - **boolean_search_strategies**: Suggest specific combinations using Boolean operators (e.g., \"(diabetes mellitus OR diabetes) AND (chest pain OR angina) AND (exercise test OR stress test)\").\r\n    \r\n    - **alternative_pico_formulations**: If the scenario allows different interpretations or approaches, offer alternative PICO question formulations.\r\n    \r\n    - **recommended_study_types**: Based on the PICO question type, indicate which study types would be most appropriate (e.g., RCT for therapy, cohort studies for prognosis, etc.).\r\n\r\n    {{ ctx.output_format }}\r\n  \"#\r\n}\r\n\r\n// --- Specialized Functions for Different Research Types (Example: Clinical Trial Analysis)
