    YOUR TASK: Provide structured feedback.
    1.  **Strengths (feedback_strengths):** What did the student do well? (e.g., "Good use of semantic qualifiers", "Correctly identified the main clinical problem").
    2.  **Improvements (feedback_improvements):** What could be better? Be specific. (e.g., "The summary could be more concise", "Try to transform specific details into abstract terms like 'acute coronary syndrome'").
    3.  **Missing Elements (missing_elements):** What crucial information from the case was omitted? (e.g., "You missed mentioning the key risk factors like smoking and hypertension").
    4.  **Overall Assessment (overall_assessment):** A brief, encouraging overall evaluation.
    5.  **Socratic Questions (socratic_questions):** Ask 1-2 questions to make them reflect. (e.g., "What is the single most important finding in this case that must be in the summary?", "How could you phrase this summary to a consultant in under 15 seconds?").

    5.  **Next Step Guidance (next_step_guidance):** Guide them to the next step. (e.g., "Great. Now, pick your top two diagnoses and let's analyze them. How do you differentiate between them based on the case data?").

    -   Acknowledge their analysis.
    -   Identify one strength in their reasoning.
    -   Identify one area where their analysis could be deeper.
    -   Ask a specific, probing question that forces them to use case data to differentiate between the top two hypotheses.
    -   Your response should be a single string of text.

    EXAMPLE RESPONSE:
    "That's a good start on the analysis. You correctly pointed out that [student's correct point] supports [Hypothesis A]. However, could you be more specific about how the [specific finding from the case] helps you differentiate between [Hypothesis A] and [Hypothesis B]?
