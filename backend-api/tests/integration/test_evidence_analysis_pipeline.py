    Background: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition. Early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) has been a cornerstone of sepsis management.
    Objective: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a modified EGDT protocol compared to standard care in patients with septic shock.
    Methods: We enrolled 200 adult patients diagnosed with septic shock in the emergency department. Patients were randomized to either the EGDT group (n=100) or the standard care group (n=100). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. The study was conducted at a single tertiary care center.
    Results: The 28-day mortality was 25% in the EGDT group and 30% in the standard care group (p=0.45). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes, including length of hospital stay and duration of vasopressor use. The sample size was calculated to provide 80% power to detect a 15% absolute risk reduction.
    Conclusion: In this single-center RCT, a modified EGDT protocol did not result in a significant reduction in 28-day mortality compared to standard care for patients with septic shock.
    Limitations: The study's single-center design and the lower-than-expected mortality rate in the standard care arm may limit the generalizability of the findings.
