# End-to-End Testing Plan for Clinical-Helper-Next Backend API

## Overview
This document outlines the end-to-end (E2E) testing strategy for the clinical-helper-next backend API. E2E tests verify that all components of the application work together correctly from a user's perspective.

## Testing Environment
- **Database**: Clean test database (SQLite for testing, PostgreSQL for production-like testing)
- **Authentication**: Mock authentication service or test credentials
- **External Services**: Mock any external services used by the application

## Prerequisites
- Backend API server running
- Test data fixtures prepared
- Test user accounts with different roles (doctor, admin, etc.)

## E2E Test Scenarios

### 1. User Authentication Flow
- User registration
- User login
- Token refresh
- Password reset
- Account management
- Role-based access control

### 2. Patient Management
- Create new patient
- Retrieve patient details
- Update patient information
- Delete patient
- Search patients by various criteria
- Pagination of patient lists

### 3. Medical Records Management
- Upload medical records (PDFs, images)
- Extract data from medical records
- View and download medical records
- Associate records with patients
- Search within medical records

### 4. Laboratory Results
- Import lab results
- Visualize lab results
- Track lab result history
- Compare lab results over time
- Generate reports from lab results

### 5. Medications Management
- Prescribe medications
- Update medication details
- Track medication history
- Generate medication reports
- Check medication interactions

### 6. Clinical Notes
- Create clinical notes
- Update clinical notes
- Search within notes
- Categorize notes by type
- Associate notes with patient visits

### 7. Alert System
- Generate alerts based on lab results
- Prioritize alerts by severity
- Notification delivery
- Alert acknowledgment
- Alert history tracking

### 8. AI Chat System
- Initiate AI chat conversations
- Chat message persistence
- Chat history retrieval
- AI response generation
- Integration with medical knowledge base

### 9. Analysis and Reporting
- Generate patient summaries
- Create statistical reports
- Export data in various formats
- Dashboard data aggregation
- Trend analysis over time

## Testing Approach

### API Testing Methods
1. **Sequential Workflows**: Test complete workflows from start to finish
2. **Integration Points**: Focus on integration between different modules
3. **Error Handling**: Verify system behavior under error conditions
4. **Performance**: Validate system performance under load
5. **Security**: Test authentication, authorization, and data protection

### Test Data Management
- Create fixtures for common entities (users, patients, records)
- Reset database between test runs
- Create isolated test environments

## Implementation Plan

### Tools and Frameworks
- Pytest for test execution
- Requests or HTTPX for API calls
- PyTest-FastAPI for direct FastAPI testing
- Locust or K6 for performance testing

### Test Structure
```python
# Example E2E test for patient creation and retrieval
def test_patient_creation_and_retrieval(client, auth_headers):
    # Create patient
    patient_data = {...}
    response = client.post("/api/patients/", json=patient_data, headers=auth_headers)
    assert response.status_code == 201
    
    # Get created patient ID
    patient_id = response.json()["patient_id"]
    
    # Retrieve patient
    response = client.get(f"/api/patients/{patient_id}", headers=auth_headers)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    
    # Verify patient data
    retrieved_data = response.json()
    assert retrieved_data["name"] == patient_data["name"]
    # ... more assertions
```

## Continuous Integration
- Run E2E tests on each pull request
- Run nightly full test suite
- Generate test reports and metrics

## Test Monitoring
- Track test coverage over time
- Monitor test failure rates
- Identify flaky tests
- Test performance analysis

## Conclusion
This E2E testing plan provides a comprehensive approach to validate the functionality, reliability, and performance of the clinical-helper-next backend API. By implementing these tests, we ensure that the system works correctly from a user's perspective and maintains its quality as new features are added.
