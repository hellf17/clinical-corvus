## Introduction (1 minute)

**(Presenter: Dr. Corvus AI Voiceover / Live Presenter)**

"Welcome to Clinical Corvus, your advanced clinical co-pilot. Today, we're excited to showcase the **Differential Diagnosis Academy**, a powerful module designed to sharpen diagnostic reasoning skills for healthcare professionals and medical students. This module goes beyond theoretical knowledge, offering interactive tools to systematically expand differential diagnoses, generate critical diagnostic questions with AI, and compare hypotheses using real-world clinical cases."

## Section 1: Expandindo o DDx (Expanding Differential Diagnoses) - (3-4 minutes)

**(Presenter: Live Presenter)**

"Let's begin with 'Expandindo o DDx' – our tool for systematically expanding differential diagnoses. This feature helps clinicians and students ensure they consider a comprehensive range of possibilities, reducing the risk of premature closure and diagnostic errors."

**(Visual: Click on the "Expandindo o DDx" tab. Show a pre-filled clinical scenario or quickly type one in.)**

"Imagine a patient presenting with acute abdominal pain. Instead of immediately jumping to the most common causes, Clinical Corvus prompts us to think broadly. We can input key symptoms, signs, and patient demographics."

**(Visual: Input: "Paciente masculino, 45 anos, dor abdominal aguda em quadrante inferior direito, febre baixa, náuseas." (Male patient, 45 years old, acute abdominal pain in right lower quadrant, low-grade fever, nausea.))**

"Now, let's ask Dr. Corvus to expand our differential."

**(Visual: Click the 'Expandir DDx' or equivalent button. Show the AI generating a list of differential diagnoses.)**

"Notice how Dr. Corvus doesn't just list common conditions like appendicitis. It also suggests less common but critical diagnoses, such as Meckel's diverticulitis, regional enteritis, or even referred pain from a renal calculus. For each suggestion, it provides a brief rationale or key distinguishing features."

**(Visual: Scroll through the generated list, highlighting a few diverse examples. Point out the rationale provided for each.)**

"This systematic approach, powered by our clinical reasoning AI, ensures that no stone is left unturned, fostering a more robust and complete diagnostic process. It's an invaluable tool for training the diagnostic mind to think comprehensively."

## Section 2: Gerar Perguntas para DDx (Generate Questions for DDx) - (3-4 minutes)

**(Presenter: Live Presenter)**

"Next, we move to 'Gerar Perguntas para DDx' – where Dr. Corvus helps us formulate the most impactful questions to narrow down our differential. Effective questioning is a cornerstone of diagnostic accuracy."

**(Visual: Click on the "Gerar Perguntas para DDx" tab. The previous DDx list might carry over, or quickly re-enter a simplified scenario.)**

"Building on our acute abdominal pain case, we now have a broad differential. The challenge is: what questions do we ask next to differentiate between these possibilities? Dr. Corvus analyzes the current differential and generates targeted questions."

**(Visual: Input: "DDx: Apendicite, Diverticulite de Meckel, Enterite Regional, Cálculo Renal." (DDx: Appendicitis, Meckel's Diverticulitis, Regional Enteritis, Renal Calculus.) Click the 'Gerar Perguntas' or equivalent button.)**

"Observe the quality of these questions. They are not generic. For instance, to differentiate appendicitis from a renal calculus, Dr. Corvus might suggest: 'A dor irradia para a virilha ou flanco?' (Does the pain radiate to the groin or flank?) or 'Há disúria ou hematúria associada?' (Is there associated dysuria or hematuria?)."

**(Visual: Highlight specific, insightful questions generated by the AI. Emphasize how they target specific conditions within the differential.)**

"The AI also prioritizes questions based on their discriminative power, guiding the user to ask questions that yield the most critical information. This teaches a structured, evidence-based approach to clinical inquiry, moving beyond rote memorization to true diagnostic strategy."

## Section 3: Comparando Hipóteses (Comparing Hypotheses) - (3-4 minutes)

**(Presenter: Live Presenter)**

"Finally, let's explore 'Comparando Hipóteses' – a sophisticated matrix analysis tool that allows us to directly compare competing diagnoses against clinical findings. This is where the art and science of diagnostic reasoning truly converge."

**(Visual: Click on the "Comparando Hipóteses" tab. Show a pre-loaded clinical case or quickly set one up with 2-3 competing diagnoses and a few key findings.)**

"Here, we can select two or more hypotheses – let's say, Appendicitis and Mesenteric Adenitis – and input relevant patient findings, such as 'Dor em FID', 'Febre', 'Leucocitose', 'Linfonodos mesentéricos aumentados na USG'." (Pain in RLQ, Fever, Leukocytosis, Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes on USG.)

**(Visual: Show the matrix populating. Highlight how the AI fills in the likelihood or typicality of each finding for each disease.)**

"Dr. Corvus populates this matrix, indicating how strongly each clinical finding supports or refutes a particular hypothesis. It leverages a vast knowledge base of illness scripts and clinical patterns. This visual representation makes it incredibly clear where the diagnostic weight lies."

**(Visual: Point to a specific cell in the matrix, explaining its significance. For example, 'Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes' would strongly support Mesenteric Adenitis but be less typical for Appendicitis.)**

"This tool is invaluable for teaching pattern recognition and for making transparent, evidence-based diagnostic decisions. It allows students to see the 'why' behind a diagnosis and helps experienced clinicians confirm their reasoning or identify subtle discrepancies."

## Conclusion (0.5-1 minute)

**(Presenter: Dr. Corvus AI Voiceover / Live Presenter)**

"The Differential Diagnosis Academy in Clinical Corvus is more than just a learning platform; it's a dynamic training ground for the diagnostic mind. By integrating AI-powered tools for hypothesis generation, question formulation, and comparative analysis, we empower healthcare professionals and students to become more precise, confident, and evidence-driven diagnosticians. This is the future of clinical education and practice."
