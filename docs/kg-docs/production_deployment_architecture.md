# Production Deployment Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for the production deployment architecture of the Clinical Corvus platform, focusing on scalability, reliability, security, and cost-effectiveness. The architecture leverages containerization, orchestration, and cloud-native services to ensure a robust and performant environment for the Knowledge Graph (KG) system and its integrated AI components.

## Design Principles

### Core Principles

1.  **Scalability**: Ability to handle increasing user load and data volumes by scaling components independently.
2.  **High Availability**: Minimize downtime and ensure continuous service operation through redundancy and fault tolerance.
3.  **Security**: Protect sensitive medical data and intellectual property through robust security measures at all layers.
4.  **Reliability**: Ensure consistent and predictable performance, with mechanisms for error handling and recovery.
5.  **Cost-Effectiveness**: Optimize resource utilization and leverage managed services to reduce operational costs.
6.  **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing to provide deep insights into system behavior.
7.  **Automation**: Automate deployment, scaling, and operational tasks to reduce manual effort and human error.

### Key Considerations

-   **Microservices Architecture**: Each major component (Frontend, Backend API, MCP Server, KG, Search Stores, AI Models) is deployed as an independent service.
-   **Cloud-Native**: Designed for deployment on a major cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) leveraging their managed services.
-   **Containerization**: All services are containerized using Docker for consistency across environments.
-   **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (K8s) for container orchestration, scaling, and management.
-   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use tools like Terraform or Pulumi for declarative infrastructure provisioning.
-   **CI/CD**: Automated pipelines for continuous integration and continuous deployment.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend (Next.js App Router)

-   **Deployment**: Static site generation (SSG), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), and **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** deployed on a CDN (e.g., Vercel, AWS CloudFront).
-   **Scalability**: CDN handles global distribution and caching. ISR provides a balance between static performance and dynamic content freshness. SSR can scale using serverless functions or container instances.
-   **Security**: WAF (Web Application Firewall), DDoS protection, HTTPS, and **regional edge caching controls** for HIPAA/GDPR compliance.
-   **Managed Service (Example)**: Vercel for Next.js, or AWS Amplify/CloudFront.

### 2. Backend API (FastAPI) & MCP Server (FastAPI)

-   **Deployment**: Containerized FastAPI applications deployed on Kubernetes with **zero-downtime rolling deployments**.
-   **Scalability**: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) based on CPU/memory or custom metrics.
-   **High Availability**: Multiple replicas across availability zones.
-   **Communication**: Consider **gRPC support** between MCP and backend for efficient, high-volume KG/RAG calls.
-   **Security**: API Gateway for auth, rate limiting, and WAF. Network policies within K8s.
-   **Managed Service (Example)**: AWS EKS, Azure AKS, GCP GKE.

### 3. Knowledge Graph (Neo4j)

-   **Deployment**:
    -   **Hybrid Strategy**: Start with **Neo4j Aura** for speed and ease of management. Design Helm charts/StatefulSets for a potential future migration to a self-managed cluster if required by regulations.
-   **Scalability**: Aura handles scaling automatically. For self-managed, scale horizontally with Core/Read Replica instances.
-   **High Availability**: Aura provides built-in HA. For self-managed, use a Causal Cluster and **read replicas behind a query router** (Neo4j Fabric or load balancer).
-   **Security**: Network isolation, strict access control, and encryption at rest/in-transit.

### 4. Search Stores (BM25 & Vector)

-   **Deployment**:
    -   **Managed Service (Recommended)**: AWS OpenSearch Service (for BM25) and dedicated vector databases like Pinecone or Weaviate.
    -   **Self-Managed on K8s**: Elasticsearch/ChromaDB as StatefulSets.
-   **Synchronization**: **Clarify the sync model**â€”e.g., populate both stores in parallel during ingestion to avoid data skew.
-   **Security**: Network isolation, encryption, and access control.

### 5. AI Models (Clinical RoBERTa, Mistral, LLMs)

-   **Deployment**:
    -   **Remote APIs**: Leverage external LLM providers (OpenRouter, Gemini).
    -   **Self-Hosted on K8s**: Deploy fine-tuned models (e.g., Clinical RoBERTa) on GPU-enabled nodes. Include a **GPU training service (e.g., SageMaker)** for continual fine-tuning.
-   **Scalability**: External APIs scale automatically. Self-hosted models scale with HPA.
-   **High Availability**: Redundancy for self-hosted models.
-   **Security**: Secure API keys and network policies.

### 6. Data Storage (PostgreSQL)

-   **Deployment**: Managed Relational Database Service (e.g., AWS RDS).
-   **Scalability**: Vertical scaling, read replicas.
-   **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployments, automated backups.
-   **Security**: Network isolation, encryption, IAM roles.

### 7. Message Queue (Recommended for Ingestion)

-   **Purpose**: Decouple components, handle ingestion bursts, and enable asynchronous processing. **Essential for robust KG ingestion pipelines.**
-   **Deployment**: Managed message queue service (e.g., AWS SQS, Kafka).

### 8. Monitoring & Logging

-   **Metrics**: Prometheus for time-series metrics, Grafana for dashboards.
-   **Logging & Tracing**: Centralized logging (ELK, Loki) and distributed tracing (Jaeger, OpenTelemetry).
-   **Alerting**: Integration with **PagerDuty, OpsGenie, or Slack** for on-call notifications.
-   **Synthetic Monitoring**: Health checks that simulate end-user queries to proactively detect issues.

### 9. CI/CD Pipeline

### 10. CI/CD Pipeline

-   **Tools**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline/CodeBuild/CodeDeploy.
-   **Functionality**: Automated testing, static code analysis, container image building, vulnerability scanning, deployment to Kubernetes clusters.

## Network Architecture

-   **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Isolate all resources within a private network.
-   **Subnets**: Private subnets for application components and databases, public subnets for load balancers/NAT gateways.
-   **Security Groups/Network ACLs**: Restrict traffic between components to the absolute minimum required.
-   **Load Balancers**:
    -   **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: For HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the Frontend and Backend API.
    -   **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: For high-performance TCP traffic (e.g., to Neo4j Bolt port if self-managed).
-   **Private Endpoints/Service Endpoints**: For secure and private connectivity to managed cloud services without traversing the public internet.
-   **VPN/Direct Connect**: Secure access for administrators and internal systems.

## Security Considerations

-   **Authentication & Authorization**: Clerk for user authentication, JWT validation in Backend, and RBAC in Kubernetes.
-   **Data Privacy & Compliance**:
    -   **De-identification Pipeline**: Anonymize patient data at the point of ingestion.
    -   **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of who queried what and when.
    -   **Data Residency**: Controls to keep PHI within specific geographic regions.
-   **Data Encryption**: TLS 1.3 in transit and AES-256 at rest for all data stores.
-   **Secrets Management**: Use a managed secret store like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.
-   **Vulnerability Management**: Regular scanning of container images and dependencies.

## Scalability & High Availability Strategy

-   **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)**: For stateless services (Backend, MCP, AI models).
-   **Global Load Balancing**: Use services like Cloudflare or AWS Global Accelerator for multi-region failover.
-   **Database Scaling**:
    -   **PostgreSQL**: Read replicas for read-heavy workloads.
    -   **Neo4j**: Causal Clustering with read replicas behind a query router.
    -   **Search Stores**: Horizontal scaling by adding more nodes/shards.
-   **High Availability**:
    -   **Multi-AZ Deployment**: For all critical components.
    -   **Redundancy**: Multiple replicas for stateless services and database replication.
    -   **Automated Failover & Backups**: For rapid disaster recovery.

## Cost Optimization

-   **FinOps Loop**: Implement a monthly review of cloud spend with recommendations for right-sizing resources.
-   **GPU Management**: Use **Karpenter (AWS)** or node auto-provisioning (GKE) to dynamically add/remove GPU nodes, avoiding waste.
-   **Spot Instances**: For fault-tolerant workloads like batch processing.
-   **Reserved Instances/Savings Plans**: For predictable, long-running workloads.
-   **Serverless**: Use for event-driven or bursty workloads where applicable.
