2.  **Real-time Insights**: Provide immediate feedback on system health and performance.
3.  **Actionable Alerts**: Generate timely and specific alerts for anomalies or issues.
4.  **Data-Driven Improvement**: Use collected metrics to identify areas for optimization and enhancement.
5.  **Transparency and Auditability**: Maintain detailed logs and audit trails for compliance and debugging.
6.  **Scalability**: Ensure the monitoring infrastructure can handle increasing data volumes and system complexity.
7.  **Customizability**: Allow for flexible configuration of metrics, dashboards, and alerts.

### Key Focus Areas

1.  **Data Quality Monitoring**: Track the quality and integrity of data within the KG and search indices.
2.  **Pipeline Performance Monitoring**: Measure the efficiency and throughput of data ingestion and processing pipelines.
3.  **AI Model Performance Monitoring**: Evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of Clinical RoBERTa and Langroid agents.
4.  **System Health Monitoring**: Oversee the operational status and resource utilization of all services.
5.  **User Experience Monitoring**: Track user engagement and satisfaction with the system.
6.  **Security and Compliance Monitoring**: Ensure adherence to data privacy and security regulations.

## Implementation Details

### Metrics Collection

- [ ] Implement user experience metrics (e.g., search relevance, agent satisfaction).
- [ ] Set up alerting rules for critical data quality and model performance deviations.
- [ ] Develop initial automated reports.

### Phase 4: Security, Compliance, and Continuous Improvement

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual metric collectors and loggers.
- Test alerting rules with simulated data.

### Integration Testing
- Verify that all components correctly send metrics and logs to the central system.
- Test the end-to-end alerting process.
- Validate that dashboards display accurate and real-time information.

### Performance Testing
- Stress test the monitoring infrastructure to ensure it can handle peak loads.
- Measure the overhead introduced by monitoring.

### Data Integrity Testing
- Regularly verify the integrity and completeness of collected metrics and logs.
- Test backup and restore procedures for monitoring data.

## Future Enhancements

-   **Self-Healing Pipelines**: If ingestion latency spikes, automatically scale workers or re-route jobs.
-   **Hybrid Anomaly Detection**: Combine Prometheus rules with ML-based anomaly detectors (e.g., Prophet for trend forecasting) for more nuanced issue detection.
-   **Agent Trust Scores**: Track per-agent reliability scores (e.g., "Langroid agent X answered correctly in 83% of oncology queries last week").
-   **Clinical Validation Mode**: For every AI-generated output, provide a confidence score plus a link to KG provenance, and monitor how often users request this provenance expansion.
-   **Predictive Analytics**: Use machine learning models to predict future performance issues or data quality degradation.
-   **Automated Remediation**: Implement automated scripts to address common issues detected by the monitoring system.
-   **Root Cause Analysis**: Develop tools to automatically assist in identifying the root cause of complex system failures.
