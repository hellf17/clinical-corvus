# Clinical Corvus

*This is the main documentation. For the full Brazilian Portuguese version, see [README_pt-BR.md](./README_pt-BR.md).*

Clinical Corvus is a digital platform for clinical data analysis, decision support, and patient monitoring, leveraging Artificial Intelligence (Dr. Corvus) in a secure, privacy-focused environment. The platform is designed for both physicians (management and analysis) and patients (health tracking and education). Our vision is to act as a **"Clinical Co-pilot"** for doctors, optimizing workflows, and empowering patients with health tracking and education tools. **Compliance with LGPD/HIPAA and data security are top priorities.**

**Current Status:** The platform is functional, featuring *patient management, contextual AI chat, clinical data visualizations, clinical notes with a rich text editor*, a fully modernized Analysis page (`/analysis`) with redesigned UI, complete interface translation to Portuguese, advanced Dr. Corvus Insights system, elegant loading states, and robust error handling for both PDF exam uploads and manual data entry with backend abnormality checks. The "Clinical Academy" section (`/academy`) for clinical reasoning training uses dedicated BAML functions, with ALL 15 educational APIs 100% translated to Portuguese, eliminating language barriers. The scientific research system (`/academy/evidence-based-medicine`) has been expanded with new sources (Europe PMC, Lens.org) and a powerful quality and deduplication analysis system (CiteSource), operating on a unified bibliometric API architecture that provides rich, detailed metrics. Modern technologies include Next.js App Router, Clerk, Shadcn/UI, FastAPI, and Docker. The system features advanced exam processing via PDF upload, automatic extraction and enrichment of lab results, and expanded graphical and tabular data visualizations. We are migrating internal AI frameworks (ElizaOS > Langroid, LlamaParse > Marker) and advancing the implementation of the AI core with **hybrid GraphRAG architecture (KG + BM25/Vector) as our source of truth, populated with curated knowledge using Clinical RoBERTa for KG building and reranking, Mistral for query reformulation, and other SOTA LLMs for core medical reasoning.**

## API Routing and Proxy Pattern

### Backend Routing
- All backend API endpoints are exposed under the `/api/*` prefix, with routers included in `main.py` (e.g., `/api/research`, `/api/clinical`).
- No internal prefixes are set in router files; all prefixing is handled centrally in `main.py` for consistency.
- Example backend endpoints:
  - `/api/research/formulate-pico-translated`
  - `/api/research/quick-search-translated`
  - `/api/clinical/differential-diagnosis`

### Frontend Proxy
- All `/api/*` routes in the frontend act as proxies, forwarding requests to the backend at the same path.
- No translation or business logic is handled in the frontend API routes; they only proxy requests and responses.
- Example proxy route:
  - `frontend/src/app/api/research-assistant/formulate-pico-translated/route.ts` â†’ proxies to `/api/research/formulate-pico-translated` on the backend.

### Routing Summary
- This design eliminates route duplication and ensures seamless integration between frontend and backend.
- For new endpoints, always add the router in `main.py` with the desired `/api/<domain>` prefix, and create a matching proxy route in the frontend if needed.

### Quick Research Workflow

| Step | Component | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | **Query Pre-processing (`simple_autonomous_research.py`)** | â€¢ Expansion of medical abbreviations in PT.<br>â€¢ Automatic translation to EN (DeepL â†’ BAML) with robust error handling.<br>â€¢ Synonym expansion.<br>â€¢ Generation/simplification via BAML (PICO / keywords). |
| 2 | **Layered PubMed Search (`UnifiedPubMedService`)** | â€¢ Tier 1 â€“ Original/expanded query.<br>â€¢ Tier 2 â€“ Simplified query.<br>â€¢ Tier 3 â€“ PICO query.<br>â€¢ `_apply_default_language_filter` ensures `english[lang]`.<br>â€¢ Enrichment with metrics (Altmetric, iCite) and scoring. |
| 3 | **Supplementary Academic Sources** | â€¢ `EuropePMCService` for OA outside PubMed.<br>â€¢ `LensScholarService` optional (priority â†“ if `LENS_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` absent). |

### Main Components:

1.  **Frontend (Next.js App Router):** User interface, dashboards, interactions, and visualizations.
2.  **Backend API (FastAPI):** Core business logic, data management, integration with BAML and external services.
3.  **MCP Server (FastAPI):** Context generation for AI, hybrid GraphRAG pipeline (KG + BM25/Vector), Knowledge Graph interaction, and CiteSource engine.
4.  **Database (PostgreSQL):** Persistent application data storage.
5.  **Clerk:** Authentication and user management service.
6.  **BAML (Boundary):** AI engine for clinical reasoning, research, and educational features.
7.  **External Services:** Bibliometric APIs, LLMs, etc.

### Translation Strategy for AI Features
To ensure high performance of language models (LLMs) and a native experience in Portuguese, **all translation logic is now centralized in the backend**:

1. **User Input (PT-BR):** Input provided by the user in Portuguese is sent from the frontend to the backend without any prior translation.
2. **Backend Processing:** The backend translates to English using DeepL as the primary engine, with automatic fallback to BAML if it fails. Then, BAML functions (prompts and logic in English) are executed.
3. **Output to User (PT-BR):** The response generated by BAML in English is translated back to Portuguese in the backend (using DeepL/BAML) before being returned to the frontend.

**Important:** Frontend API routes act only as proxies and should not implement translation logic or import/use DeepL, BAML, or any translation service directly. All translation occurs exclusively in the backend, ensuring consistency, auditability, and ease of maintenance.

**Frontend Proxy Example:**
```ts
// frontend/src/app/api/some-translated-route/route.ts
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // ...authentication...
  const backendUrl = `${process.env.BACKEND_URL}/api/some-translated-route`;
  const response = await fetch(backendUrl, { ... });
  return NextResponse.json(await response.json(), { status: response.status });
}
```
