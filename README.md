# Clinical Corvus

Clinical Corvus is a digital platform for clinical data analysis, decision support, and patient monitoring, leveraging Artificial Intelligence (Dr. Corvus) in a secure, privacy-focused environment. The platform is designed for both physicians (management with AI, analysis, some tools on academy - DDx, advanced research) and students/residents (management with AI, analysis, academy modules, AI support). Our vision is to act as a **"Clinical Co-pilot"** for doctors and students, optimizing workflows and helping them to keep up with evidence based practices. We also have educational tools that leverages LLMs to train clinical thinking tools that can be used in clinical practice. **Compliance with LGPD/HIPAA and data security are top priorities.**

  - Clerk public metadata: `clinicalValidation: true` or `betaTester: true`
  - Email allowlist env: set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLINICAL_VALIDATION_TESTERS="email1@example.com,email2@org.com"`
- Feedback handling: submitted via `/api/clinical-validation/feedback` (frontend route) which logs server‚Äëside. For production, forward to a backend datastore endpoint.

### Migrations
- Alembic located at `backend-api/alembic`.
- New revision adds `user_preferences` table: `3e1b2c7f5a10_add_user_preferences_table.py`.

## Security Audit and Recommendations

A comprehensive security audit has been performed on the Clinical Corvus platform. Hardenings were applied across backend (rate limiting, cookie policy, JWT verification options, sanitization), frontend (CSP/security headers, render sanitization), and secrets management (Infisical). For the current status and actionable recommendations, see the [Security Audit and Recommendations](./security-audit.md) document.

### Production Deployment (Docker Compose)

- Use `docker-compose.prod.app.yml` for the core app stack (Postgres, Redis, Backend API, MCP Server, Frontend).
- Combine with `docker-compose.prod.yml` to add the metrics stack if desired.

Examples (with Infisical CLI injecting secrets):

```
# App stack only
infisical run --env=Production -- docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.app.yml up -d

# App + metrics stacks
infisical run --env=Production -- docker compose \
  -f docker-compose.prod.app.yml \
  -f docker-compose.prod.yml \
  up -d
```

Recommended production env values:
- `FRONTEND_URL=https://www.clinical-corvus.app`
- `CORS_ORIGINS=https://www.clinical-corvus.app`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://api.clinical-corvus.app` (if browser must call API directly)
- `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER` / `CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE` for strict Clerk token verification

### Infisical: CLI bulk import from `.env`

To import secrets without the UI, use the provided scripts that call `infisical secrets set` for each key:

```
# macOS/Linux
PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id> ENV_SLUG=Production \
  ./scripts/infisical_import_from_env.sh .env

# Windows PowerShell
./scripts/infisical_import_from_env.ps1 -EnvFile .env -ProjectId <your-project-id> -EnvSlug Production
```

Notes:
- Scripts ignore comments/blank lines and handle quoted values. Adjust as needed for paths or secret scoping.
- If your CLI version supports native bulk from file, you may also use `infisical secrets set --from-file .env` (see Infisical CLI docs).
- After importing, run the app with Infisical: `infisical run --env=Production -- docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.app.yml up -d`.

## API Routing and Proxy Pattern

### Backend Routing
- All backend API endpoints are exposed under the `/api/*` prefix, with routers included in `main.py` (e.g., `/api/research`, `/api/clinical`).
- No internal prefixes are set in router files; all prefixing is handled centrally in `main.py` for consistency.
- Agents: endpoints are consolidated in `backend-api/routers/agents_router.py` and mounted under both `/api/agents/*` (canonical) and `/api/mvp-agents/*` (legacy shim).
- Example backend endpoints:
  - `/api/research/formulate-pico-translated`
 - `/api/research/quick-search-translated`
  - `/api/clinical/differential-diagnosis`

### Frontend Proxy
- All `/api/*` routes in the frontend act as proxies, forwarding requests to the backend at the same path.
- No translation or business logic is handled in the frontend API routes; they only proxy requests and responses.
- Example proxy route:
  - `frontend/src/app/api/research-assistant/formulate-pico-translated/route.ts` ‚Üí proxies to `/api/research/formulate-pico-translated` on the backend.
  - `frontend/src/app/api/mvp-agents/*` ‚Üí proxies to `/api/mvp-agents/*` on the backend (also available at `/api/agents/*`).

### Research Agent Auth
- `/api/research/agent-research/autonomous` and `/api/research/agent-research/autonomous-translated` require authentication; Next.js proxies forward the `Authorization` header.

### Routing Summary
- This design eliminates route duplication and ensures seamless integration between frontend and backend.
- For new endpoints, always add the router in `main.py` with the desired `/api/<domain>` prefix, and create a matching proxy route in the frontend if needed.

## Implemented Features

### Authentication and Security Architecture

The platform's security is built on a robust, multi-layered architecture that ensures data privacy and compliance with standards like HIPAA and LGPD.

*   **Authentication (Clerk):** User authentication is managed by Clerk, supporting OAuth, email/password, and MFA. Clerk handles all user session management.
*   **Frontend Middleware (`frontend/src/middleware.ts`):** The Next.js middleware is the first line of defense. It protects routes based on user authentication status and role (e.g., `doctor`, `patient`). It is also responsible for forwarding the necessary authentication headers to the backend API, ensuring seamless session verification.
*   **Backend Verification (`backend-api/security.py`):** The FastAPI backend uses the official Clerk SDK to verify user sessions. The `get_verified_clerk_session_data` function validates the session token from the request cookies, providing a secure way to authenticate API requests. This method is resilient to page refreshes and ensures that the user's session is consistently maintained.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Both the frontend middleware and backend endpoints enforce strict role-based access control, ensuring that users can only access data and perform actions appropriate for their role.
*   **Data Privacy:** All patient data is handled with strict privacy controls, and the system is designed to be compliant with healthcare data regulations.

### Main Components:

1.  **Frontend (Next.js App Router):** User interface, dashboards, interactions, and visualizations.
2.  **Backend API (FastAPI):** Core business logic, data management, integration with BAML and external services.
3.  **MCP Server (FastAPI):** Context generation for AI, hybrid GraphRAG pipeline (KG + BM25/Vector), Knowledge Graph interaction, and CiteSource engine.
4.  **Database (PostgreSQL):** Persistent application data storage.
5.  **Clerk:** Authentication and user management service.
6.  **BAML (Boundary):** AI engine for clinical reasoning, research, and educational features.
7.  **External Services:** Bibliometric APIs, LLMs, etc.

### Translation Strategy for AI Features
To ensure high performance of language models (LLMs) and a native experience in Portuguese, **all translation logic is now centralized in the backend**:

1. **User Input (PT-BR):** Input provided by the user in Portuguese is sent from the frontend to the backend without any prior translation.
2. **Backend Processing:** The backend translates to English using DeepL as the primary engine, with automatic fallback to BAML if it fails. Then, BAML functions (prompts and logic in English) are executed.
3. **Output to User (PT-BR):** The response generated by BAML in English is translated back to Portuguese in the backend (using DeepL/BAML) before being returned to the frontend.

**Important:** Frontend API routes act only as proxies and should not implement translation logic or import/use DeepL, BAML, or any translation service directly. All translation occurs exclusively in the backend, ensuring consistency, auditability, and ease of maintenance.

**Frontend Proxy Example:**
```ts
// frontend/src/app/api/some-translated-route/route.ts
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // ...authentication...
  const backendUrl = `${process.env.BACKEND_URL}/api/some-translated-route`;
  const response = await fetch(backendUrl, { ... });
  return NextResponse.json(await response.json(), { status: response.status });
}
```
