# Clinical Corvus Development Plan - Updated for Paper Vision

## Notes
- **Vision Evolution**: Transition from clinical assistant to autonomous medical AI agent
- **Core Architecture**: Multi-agent system with Langroid framework, Neo4j knowledge graphs, and specialized medical models for different tasks (e.g. clinical reasoning, KG building, contradiction resolution, etc.)
