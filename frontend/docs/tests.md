# Frontend Testing Results

## Summary

We've made significant progress in setting up and fixing frontend tests for the Clinical Corvus application. Initially, there were several critical issues preventing tests from running successfully, which we've systematically resolved.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Build Errors in Components

#### AIChat.tsx Component
- **Issue**: Incorrect destructuring of the `useChat` hook, trying to extract non-existent properties
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed invalid properties (`handleSubmit`, `isLoading`, `error`, etc.) from the destructuring
  - Implemented proper local state management for input handling
  - Updated the form submission handler to work with the correct API

#### ManualLabEntryForm.tsx Component
- **Issue**: Incorrect number of arguments passed to `addManualLabResultClient` function
- **Fix**: Removed the extra `token` parameter which was not expected by the function

#### PatientOverviewClient.tsx Component
- **Issue**: Incorrect number of arguments passed to `deletePatientClient` function
- **Fix**: Removed the extra `token` parameter which was not expected by the function

#### VitalSignsEntryForm.tsx Component
- **Issue**: Incorrect number of arguments passed to `addVitalSignClient` function
- **Fix**: Removed the extra `token` parameter which was not expected by the function

#### SystemExamsViewer.tsx Component
- **Issue**: Incorrect number of arguments passed to `getPatientLabResultsClient` function
- **Fix**: Removed the extra `token` parameter which was not expected by the function

#### mvp-agents.ts Service
- **Issue**: Incorrect structure of `HealthCheckResponse` object with invalid properties
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed invalid `error` property from the response object
  - Fixed the structure to match the expected `HealthCheckResponse` type
  - Properly structured the `components` object with valid properties

#### chat.ts Types
- **Issue**: Incorrect import of `Message` type from `ai` package
- **Fix**: Updated import to use `CoreMessage` instead of `Message` to match the current API

### 2. Test Infrastructure Improvements

#### Clinical Validation Page Tests
- **Issue**: Tests were failing due to improper component mocking and missing dependencies
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Created proper mocks for all UI components used in the page
  - Fixed import issues with mocked components
  - Ensured all required dependencies are properly mocked
  - Simplified tests to focus on core functionality

## Current Status

### Successful Builds
The application now builds successfully without TypeScript errors:
```
▲ Next.js 14.2.32
- Environments: .env.local

Creating an optimized production build ...
✓ Compiled successfully
Linting and checking validity of types ...
✓ Compiled successfully
```

### Test Progress
We've successfully:
1. Fixed all critical build errors that were preventing the application from compiling
2. Set up proper mocking for UI components in tests
3. Resolved import and export issues in several components
4. Made the application buildable and testable

## Outstanding Issues

### Clinical Validation Page Tests
There are still some issues with the Clinical Validation Page tests that need to be resolved:
- Component rendering issues with mocked UI components
- Problems with accessing React hooks in the test environment
- Complex dependencies that need proper mocking

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Clinical Validation Page Tests**:
   - Fix component mocking issues
   - Resolve React hook access problems
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly mocked

2. **Expand Test Coverage**:
   - Add tests for other dashboard components
   - Implement integration tests for key user workflows
   - Add unit tests for service functions

3. **Improve Test Infrastructure**:
   - Set up better mock data for API responses
   - Implement more comprehensive component mocking
   - Add test utilities for common patterns

## Technical Notes

### Component Structure
The dashboard-doctor section contains several key components:
- Clinical Validation Page (`/dashboard-doctor/clinical-validation`)
- Groups Management (`/dashboard-doctor/groups`)
- Patient Management (`/dashboard-doctor/patients/[id]`)

### Testing Strategy
Our testing approach focuses on:
1. Mocking external dependencies to isolate component tests
2. Verifying component rendering without complex business logic
3. Ensuring proper error handling in components
4. Testing authentication flows and redirects

## Conclusion

We've made substantial progress in getting the frontend tests working. The application now builds successfully, and we've resolved most of the critical issues that were preventing tests from running. The remaining work focuses on fine-tuning the test mocks and ensuring all components can be properly tested in isolation.
